<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Have you ever wondered, how many people were, a week or a month ago, downloading or uploading the torrent, you are about to
download? Or how popular was/is torrent created by you? Or even find out information about torrent's content quality, based on its
stability over time? These were only few reasons, why the idea of Torrito was born.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Torrito is a <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> application, using <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>
database.</p>
<p>Twice a day, it reads data (number of downloaders and uploaders) from all verified <a href="http://torrentz.com/verified">Torrentz</a>
torrents. Data are then stored in Torrito's local database. Thanks to that, you can at any time see, how many people were uploading
or downloading your torrent in past.</p>
<p>Based on data Torrito collects, it also calculates each torrent's stability rank, using
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation">standard deviation</a>. This stability rank tells you, whether number of
people uploading/downloading torrent varied a lot in a past, or was relatively stable. Higher rank means more stable torrent.</p>

<h2>Any plans for the future?</h2>
<p>Here are few ideas, that may, or may not become reality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>list of new perspective torrents (the highest downloaders/uploaders increase)</li>
        <li>torrents comparison</li>
        <li>create public API, so everyone can get creative using data from Torrito</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Other</h2>
<p>Torrito was created as part of Web Application Development class, during studies on Faculty of Informatics and Information
Technologies (<a href="http://www.fiit.stuba.sk">FIIT</a>), Slovak University of Technology (<a href="http://www.stuba.sk">STU</a>).</p>
<p>Special thanks to supervisors JÃ¡n Suchal (he also had the initial idea) and Michal Barla.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>Since Torrito runs on school's server with limited storage capacity, it's only possible to gather information about
verified Torrentz torrents (at the time of writing, number is around 62 000, still increasing). Just do the math.</p>
